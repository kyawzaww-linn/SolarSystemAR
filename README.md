# Solar System AR Educational Game

## Overview

This project is an **Augmented Reality (AR) educational application** focused on the solar system, developed by **Group A5** as part of the CP3405 course. The application allows users to explore and interact with 3D models of planets, providing an engaging learning experience about the solar system.

Our primary goal is to make complex astronomical concepts accessible and enjoyable for all age groups. Users can visualize planets in real-time through AR, rotate, and manipulate the models, making the learning process interactive and immersive.

## Project Features

- **Interactive 3D Planet Models**: Users can view, rotate, and interact with detailed 3D models of planets, bringing a hands-on experience to learning about space.
- **Educational Insights**: Each planet includes educational information, allowing users to learn as they interact.
- **AR Technology Integration**: Real-time AR functionality for displaying planetary models in real-world environments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for seamless navigation and interaction with the solar system models.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Optimized to work efficiently on various iOS devices.

## Project Challenge

The challenge is to create an AR application that makes the learning experience both immersive and educational. The focus is on achieving high-quality, interactive 3D models while ensuring smooth AR performance, especially on mobile devices. The target audience includes students and astronomy enthusiasts who seek a more engaging way to learn about space.

## Development Approach

The project follows a Scrum-based approach, organized over four sprints:

1. **Sprint 1**: Foundation setup, AR integration tests, and initial prototype.
2. **Sprint 2**: Implementation of core AR functionalities such as gesture recognition.
3. **Sprint 3**: Optimization of 3D models and performance tuning for a smooth user experience.
4. **Sprint 4**: Finalizing user interface, debugging, and preparing for launch.

Each sprint includes planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure steady progress and adaptability to any emerging challenges.

## Technology Stack

- **Xcode & Swift**: For developing the AR application on iOS.
- **ARKit**: To create immersive AR interactions.
- **3D Modeling Software**: For high-quality planet models integrated into the AR experience.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/id8lab/scrum-project-tr3-2024-cp3405-tr3-2024-scrum-team-a5.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Xcode**.
3. **Run on an iOS device or simulator** with AR capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** on an AR-capable iOS device.
2. **Follow on-screen instructions** to view and interact with the planets in AR.
3. **Explore information and details** about each planet by selecting and interacting with its 3D model.

## Pros and Cons of Existing Solutions

### Pros
- **Immersive Learning**: AR enhances user engagement by visualizing planetary models in real-world settings.
- **High-Quality Models**: Detailed 3D planets provide a rich visual and educational experience.
- **User Feedback Integration**: The app is refined through iterative prototypes based on user feedback.

### Cons
- **Resource Intensive**: Developing high-quality AR experiences with 3D models demands time and optimization for mobile performance.
- **Compatibility Challenges**: Ensuring smooth performance across various devices is challenging, especially on older models.

## Team

**Group A5** consists of six members with diverse skills in AR development, UI design, and project management. The team collaborates closely, utilizing Scrum methodologies to ensure consistent progress and quality output.
